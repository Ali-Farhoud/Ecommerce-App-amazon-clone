# Amazon Clone Full Stack Project


In this project, I created an E-commerce store website that is an Amazon clone.
The website is fully functional as the client is able to :
 
- View the homepage and browse several different products for sale
- Create account and sign in 
- Add product to cart
- View order total price
- Pay for order and recieve confirmation
- view previous orders

# Technology Used

- React JS framework/library for javascript for building user interface
- React Router to implement a single page application
- Axios for fetching products from a store API to display on front end
- ContextAPI for state management
- STRIPE JS to handle payments
